## my first unity game: Plitfarmer Platformer

This repo will contain all versions of this game.

If you want to rebuild it, I am using Unity version [**2022.3.6f1**](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2022.3.6) for versions 1.1.10 and under. For the rest (1.2.0 and up), I used Unity version [**2023.2.1f1**](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2023.2.1).

If you want to contribute with your ideas, create an issue. All ideas and feedback are welcome!
