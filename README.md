## my first unity game: Plitfarmer Platformer

This repo will contain all versions of this game.
By version I mean everything in the Assets folder, plus the built version. 

*PLEASE NOTE:* the built version contains two files: UnityPlayer1.dll and UnityPlayer2.dll. These files should be combined into UnityPlayer.dll if you download them in order for the game to work.

If you want to rebuild it, I am using [**v2022.3.6f1**](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2022.3.6).

If you want to contribute with your ideas, create an issue.
