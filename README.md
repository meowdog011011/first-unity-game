## my first unity game: Plitfarmer Platformer

This repo will contain all versions of this game.
By version I mean everything in the Assets folder, plus the built version.

If you want to rebuild it, I am using Unity version [**2022.3.6f1**](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2022.3.6).

If you want to contribute with your ideas, create an issue. All ideas and feedback are welcome!
